## About Me
I am an aspiring data scientist with a keen interest in uncovering insights from data and leveraging cutting-edge tools to solve complex challenges. Eager to contribute to a team environment and apply data science skills, including Deep Learning, NLP, and Generative AI techniques, to real-world projects that drive meaningful insights and impactful results.

## Education
- **TECHNO INTERNATIONAL NEW TOWN**
  - B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (Expected June 2025)
- **THE FUTURE FOUNDATION SCHOOL**
  - ICSE: 85.4% (Year of Passing: 2019)
  - ISC: 87.75% (Year of Passing: 2021)

## Research
### Computer Vision
- **Image Enhancement** | Dec 2023 – March 2024
  - Developed and evaluated novel image enhancement techniques using CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) and RGHS (Relative Global Histogram Stretching) and modifications of these techniques for underwater images. Utilized OpenCV and Pillow (PIL) libraries for image processing and employed various evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness of the methods.
- **Object Detection** | April 2024 – Present
  - Exploring improving YOLO models by integrating attention mechanisms for more accurate object detection.

### Generative AI
- March 2024 – Present
  - Investigating multimodal generative models, particularly integrating vision transformers with large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate image captions.

## Projects
- **Multimodal Generative Model** | March 2024 - Present
  - Building a model from scratch using PyTorch to generate captions from images.
- **Document Chatbot** | February 2024 | [Link to Repo](https://github.com/Abstract-Dex/Document-Chatbot)
  - Built a chatbot using the LlamaIndex and Llama2 for querying Wikipedia documents.
- **Emotion Detector** | March 2024 | [Link to Repo](https://github.com/Abstract-Dex/Document-Chatbot)
  - Developed an emotion detector using DistilBERT to identify emotions expressed in text.
- **Stock Price Prediction** | February 2024 | [Link to Repo](https://github.com/Abstract-Dex/Stock-Price-Prediction-LSTM)
  - Built a prediction model using an LSTM network trained on Amazon's historical stock prices.
- **Time Series Forecasting** | January 2024 | [Link to Repo](https://github.com/Abstract-Dex/TimeSeries-Forecast)
  - Performed forecasting on hourly energy consumption data from PJM using data engineering techniques.
- **Spotify Data Insights** | June 2023 | [Link to Repo](https://github.com/Abstract-Dex/Spotify-Data-Insights)
  - Analyzed Spotify song data to extract valuable insights.
